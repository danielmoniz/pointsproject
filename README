A simple project for a job application to Points.com. Note that this project
contains very little CSS and no JavaScript in the name of speed. Polishing a
web application takes time!

Instructions to Test:
- Perform instructions below in "Instructions to Run".
- Navigate to the project directory.
- In order to test the project, run:
	$ python manage.py test social
	- Note that my tests are all under social/tests.py. The entire project's
	  tests can be run, but my only manually-written tests are in the 'social'
	  app. To run all tests, run:
		$ python manage.py test
